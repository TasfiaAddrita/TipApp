## Notes

This is the first time that I have ever made (or even attempted) to make an application. I really like the feeling of accomplishment that I got after seeing that my application was running. This was a good introduction application. But, I know that I have yet a lot to learn. If I was asked to make this application without the walkthrough, it would have probably taken me a considerably longer time to make.
